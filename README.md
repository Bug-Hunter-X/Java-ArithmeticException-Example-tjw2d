# Java Uncommon Error Example: ArithmeticException
This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Java: the `ArithmeticException`. This exception is thrown when a program attempts to divide an integer by zero. 

The `UncommonErrorExample.java` file showcases the error and its handling using a `try-catch` block and a `finally` block for cleanup.  The `UncommonErrorSolution.java` file offers solutions to prevent or handle this issue in a production setting.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the Java file using a Java compiler (like the one included in the JDK): `javac UncommonErrorExample.java`
3. Run the compiled code: `java UncommonErrorExample`

## Solution
The most effective way to deal with potential division by zero is to add input validation to ensure a divisor is not zero. In situations where zero is a valid possibility, the solution might involve alternative calculations or fallback values. This is demonstrated in `UncommonErrorSolution.java`.
